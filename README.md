== Hubot GF

Hubot GF teams up with Hubot to perform tasks. Because she runs in a Rails app, Hubot GF can be much more powerful 
than Hubot and together they can be very powerful.

=== Why

I noticed that devs didn't care to write custom Hubot scripts when we launched Hubot with our team. I started Hubot GF to 
make Hubot scripting a little easier:

- Devs are more comfortable with Ruby than Coffee (or JS)
- Devs are more comfortable inside a Rails app than a Node app
- Deploying new Rails code was something built into our process, Node was not
- Things are easier in Ruby (HTTP, SSH, etc)

With Hubot GF, devs don't need to edit Hubot scripts at all. The commands are defined within any Rails app that includes 
the Hubot GF engine.
